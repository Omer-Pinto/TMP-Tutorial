# TMP-Tutorial
The code in this project is used as a base for a set of LinkedIn articles on C++ metaprogramming advanced techniques.
Specifically, I use an advanced TMP technique to solve a general database problem, I refer to as: 'the problem of database functions implementation fan out'.

From my experience, most people believe that C++ TMP is too complex, purely academic and generally should be avoided at all cost on production code (especially if you don't want your SW programmers to kill themselves :)).
You can read more about it my previous article [The beauty and the beast](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beauty-beast-omer-pinto).
This project and relevant articles (still being written) are my contribution to the proof that the above claim is pure nonsense.
I preesent a real-world problem in databases and the way it is handled in modern C/C++ databases (hint: no TMP whatsoever) and then show a solution in TMP that solves the problem with satisfying performance.
Once the articles will be available, I'll add their links to this page.
